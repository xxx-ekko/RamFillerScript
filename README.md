# Smart RAM Filler ðŸ§ 

A Python script designed to test system performance under high memory load. Unlike simple allocation scripts, this tool actively monitors real-time system RAM usage and works to maintain it at a specific target percentage.

## Features

-   **Targeted Filling**: Fills your system's RAM to a specific percentage (e.g., 95%).
-   **Active Monitoring**: Continuously checks the actual system-wide memory usage using `psutil`.
-   **Dynamic Allocation**: If the OS frees up memory (e.g., by swapping to disk), the script detects this and allocates more RAM to get back to the target.
-   **Non-Compressible Data**: Uses random bytes (`os.urandom`) to ensure that physical RAM is being used, bypassing OS-level memory compression.
